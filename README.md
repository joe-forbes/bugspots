## Bugspots
### #scan(opts, callback, [commitFilterCallback])

**opts** is an object containing the following:
```json
{
  repo: <repo>,
  headId: <commitish> || 'master',
  tailId: <commitish> || '',
  maxDepth: <integer> || 500,
  regex: <regex> || /\b(fix(es|ed)?|close(s|d)?)\b/i,
  useRelativeDates: <boolean> || false,
  batchSize: <integer> || 500
}
```
**callback** is a function with the signature (err, hotspots). When bugspots rankings are completed, this function is passed an array of hotspot objects with the following structure:
```json
{
  file: <path/within/repo>,
  score: <number>,
  fixCommits: <integer>,
  firstCommit: <date>,
  lastCommit: <date>
}
```
**commitFilterCallback** is a function with the signature (commit). This is called for each commit being analyzed. If a truthy value is returned by this function for a given commit, that commit will be treated as a bugfix commit for bugspots rankings. The commit object is part of the commits array returned by a call to the gift npm package's repo.commits() method, and (at some time recently) had at least the following properties that might be useful in determining if a commit should be included or not:
```json
{
  id: <commitHash>,
  committed_date: <date>,
  message: <string>,
  ...
}
```
